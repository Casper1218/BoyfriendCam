Please read the following files to understand the project context:

1. README.md - Project overview and setup instructions
2. CLAUDE.md - Development guidelines, architecture, and project instructions
3. Check for any FEATURE_*.md files in the root directory (e.g., FEATURE_1.md) and read the most relevant one based on current work or the most recent feature file

After reading these files, provide a brief summary of:
- What phase/feature we're currently working on
- What's been completed so far
- What's next in the roadmap
- Any important context or decisions from recent development

Do NOT create any files or make changes during onboarding - just familiarize yourself with the project state and provide the summary.
